Let’s say I want to raise my price, or set my OBJKTs as “not for sale”.

1. Make sure your wallet is synced
2. Click on [collectors] and then [cancel]. This will send the OBJKTs back to your wallet. Check your wallet for confirmation.
3. Now that they are back in your wallet, you can [swap] them again.

***

**Important:** _If you try to [swap] on OBJKTs that are currently for sale, your wallet will throw a warning saying that you have `insufficient funds`. This is because you already sent your OBJKTs out of your wallet in the first swap. You need to [cancel] to get the OBJKTs back in your wallet, and then you can [swap] them again._
