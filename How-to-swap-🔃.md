**swap**

1: _(noun)_ an act, instance, or process of exchanging one thing for another

2: _(verb)_ to set a price for your OBJKT

***

1. Click on your OBJKT's link to see the details. If you are still synced to your wallet, you should see “Swap” next to “info” and “owners”. (If you don’t see these options, then you have to sync your wallet again.)
2. Click on swap
3. Input how many OBJKTs out of your edition that you want to set for sale. For example, If you have `10`, and you want to keep `1`, and sell `9`, then input `9`. If you want to sell all of them, input `10`.
4. Input how much each edition number should cost in Tezos
5. Hit the [swap] button. Approve in your wallet.

**Important:** _Check in your wallet if the swap went through. Times vary for how long the confirmation should take, but it usually takes a couple of minutes._

***

**Hint:** _When you are swapping, you are sending an amount of OBJKTs of your edition out of your wallet. They're being held in a Hic et Nunc escrow wallet ready to be transferred to the buyer, which is why they're no longer visible in your collection. The ability to keep them visible is a feature that's been requested. Once the blockchain transaction is finished, the price should be set on the OBJKT and available for purchase, and your wallet should say that you sent that amount of OBJKTs._
