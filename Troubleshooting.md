## I found a bug. How do I report it?
Head over to the [github issues](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/issues) to see if the issue hasn't already been reported. If it hasn't, you can submit it.

## I'm having trouble syncing.
Try opening an incognito tab or clearing your cookies/cache to restart the wallet connection. You can also try a different browser. Also, try to "unsync" and then sync again.

## How do I edit the description of my NFT after I minted it?
A transaction on a blockchain is irreversible. Once minted, you cannot edit the title, description, or tags. We recommend you consider burning it.

## I minted an NFT twice by mistake. What do you suggest I do?
Usually we would tell you to burn one, but if the burn feature isn't working, we would suggest to wait a couple of days until it works. If you just started your account and can afford to start over from a new wallet, that is also an option.

## Nothing is working and I've tried all the troubleshooting possible. What should I do?
We recommend to wait at least one day. The developers are constantly pushing updates to the site, and sometimes patience is the best answer.

## Features not yet implemented. (At the moment there is no ETA or timeline available)
* Changing % of royalties when your NFT is resold
* Deleting tags already set in your NFT
