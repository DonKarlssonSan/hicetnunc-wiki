## I found a bug. How do I report it?
Head over to the [github issues](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/issues) to see if the issue hasn't already been reported. If it hasn't, you can submit it.

## I'm having trouble syncing.
Try opening an incognito tab or clearing your cookies/cache to restart the wallet connection. You can also try a different browser. Also, try clicking the hamburger menu to "unsync" and then sync again.

## How do I edit the description of my NFT after I minted it?
A transaction on a blockchain is irreversible. Once minted, you cannot edit the title, description, or tags. We recommend you consider burning it.

## I minted an NFT twice by mistake. What do you suggest I do?
Usually we would tell you to burn one, but if the burn feature isn't working, we would suggest to wait a couple of days until it works. If you just started your account and can afford to start over from a new wallet, that is also an option.

## Nothing is working and I've tried all the troubleshooting possible. What should I do?
We recommend to wait at least one day. The developers are constantly pushing updates to the site, and sometimes patience is the best answer.

## Wallet Errors
### I got "Storage quota exceeded for the operation" error - what happened?

The error _"Storage quota exceeded for the operation. A script or one of its callee wrote more bytes than the operation said it would"_ arises when the Tezos blockchain network is busy with lots of transactions. You might see this as "Backtracked" in the list of operations in your wallet.

The action you were trying to do will not have been completed, and you can retry it safely. Some wallets may have offered you the opportunity to increase the amount of storage fees, and increasing by, say, 3% usually results in a successful transaction.

It's worth noting that all transaction attempts, including failed ones, do incur small blockchain network fees which are not recoverable.


### I got "FA_2 insufficient balance" error when swapping - what happened?

The usual cause for this is trying to swap more items that were minted. If you minted 10 items and try to swap 20, you'll receive this error.
