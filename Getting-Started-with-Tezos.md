First you will need Tezos and a Tezos wallet.

## What is Tezos?
Tezos (XTZ) is a liquid proof-of-stake cryptocurrency (LPoS). You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezos)

## What wallets do you recommend?
Most of our users use [Kukai wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/) or [Temple wallet](https://templewallet.com/). We've seen issues with Airgap so we don't recommend it.

## Where to buy tezos
Minting on hicetnunc only costs ~0.08 tezos. You can buy some on an exchange site like Binance or Kraken, however we recommend consulting with someone who is from whatever country you are in because exchange services are provided depending on the country.
