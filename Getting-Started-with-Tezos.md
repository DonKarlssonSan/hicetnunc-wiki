First you will need Tezos and a Tezos wallet.

## What wallets do you recommend?
Most of our users use Kukai wallet or Temple wallet.

## Where to buy tezos
Minting on hicetnunc only costs ~0.08 tezos, so you can either buy some on an exchange site like Binance or Kraken. We recommend consulting with someone who is from whatever country you are in because exchange services are provided depending on the country.

## The hicetnunc tezos fountain â›²
You can also request to take some tezos from the Hicetnunc tezos fountain. Message @devetec or @violetforest on the discord and we will send you some tezos to mint your first OBJKT.
