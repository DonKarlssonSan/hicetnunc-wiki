First you will need Tezos and a Tezos wallet.

## What is Tezos?
Tezos (XTZ) is a liquid proof-of-stake cryptocurrency (LPoS). You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezos)

## What wallets do you recommend?
Most of our users use [Kukai wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/) or [Temple wallet](https://templewallet.com/). We've seen issues with Airgap so we don't recommend it.

## Where to buy tezos
Minting on hicetnunc only costs ~0.08 tezos. You can buy some on an exchange site like Binance or Kraken, however we recommend consulting with someone who is from whatever country you are in because exchange services are provided depending on the country.

## The hicetnunc tezos fountain â›²
If you are an artist, you can also request to take some tezos from the Hicetnunc tezos fountain. Please follow the instructions below:

1. Post the fountain emoji on one of your socials so we can verify you are the artist
2. Message us in the #tezos-fountain channel on the discord with your tezos wallet address and a link to your social media post. [Discord](https://discord.gg/pkTGvsN4)
3. We will send 0.33 TEZ to mint and swap your first OBJKTs. Please allow at least 24 hours for us to get back to you.
