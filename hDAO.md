## What are those little circles on each post? hDAO? What is that?
hDAO is a token distributed for buyer/sellers and can be used to compose a decentralized feed on the blockchain by making it possible to distribute and to claim hDAOs between the community. The hDAO feed filters the NFTs with the most "upvotes" (hDAO balances).

When you click on the circle, it is like upvoting an NFT. When you upvote, you send hDAO tokens to the NFT creator (The hDAOs are directed to the specific NFT). The creator of the NFT can choose to withdraw the hDAOs from their wallet, keep it, or use it to vote on other artworks. As the creator withdraws or spends the hDAOs, the balance will be reduced and the NFT will fall in the position of the feed.
