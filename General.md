## I have an idea for a new feature or an improvement! Where can I submit it?
You can submit your feature [here](https://hicetnunc.featureupvote.com/) and the community will be able to vote on it. Please only submit your feature if it is not already on the list. The official way to submit features to the developers is on the [github issues](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/issues). There is also the #feature-requests and #suggestions channel in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/9qkgRsqa).

## What is this 2.5% fee?
The fee means that when your OBJKT sells, Hicetnunc will charge 2.5% of the sale. It is used to maintain the server. We suggest factoring this into your sell price to cover the costs.

## How to avoid copyminters
Unfortunately, there are people minting NFTs who did not create what they upload. These copyminters, as we call them, try to make a quick buck with art from other people. Collectors have to very careful and try to find out who the artists are and if the art is genuine.

To make it easier for them, please leave a trace to any social profile or website in the description of your artwork, so potential buyers can validate the authenticity. If you can link the NFTs the artist is advertising on the profile with the NFTs on Hicetnunc, you can assume it is legit.
