### Long answer: 
hicetnunc fetches the profile information from https://tzkt.io so to get your name associated with your wallet address you need to contact tzkt.io. They will ask you to fill in a form and to transfer a small amount of tez from your wallet to prove it is really you.

1. Go to your hic et nunc profile
2. Click your wallet address link, you will navigate to tzkt.io
3. Hover the mouse over the contact icons
4. A pop-up will be displayed "You can share your email and other contacts."
5. Click the share link
6. A new pop-up will be displayed which contains their contact information
7. They will send you instructions on how to proceed.
8. They will ask you to fill in a form with your contact information
9. They will ask you to transfer 0.00177 tez to their address and provide the transaction in the form

## Help, I submitted the form over 72 hours ago but nothing has changed.

Thats a question for the baking bad team, as hicetnunc doesn't have any control over it. You can try contact them on Telegram or resubmitting the form. https://t.me/baking_bad_chat
